React Class Components
Class-Based Components


Class-based components in React are a way to define components using ES6 classes. These components must extend from React.Component and include a render method that returns the HTML to be rendered.

Example
Here's an example of a simple class-based component:



class Cat extends React.Component {
  render() {
    return <h1>Meow</h1>;
  }
}
Note
The name of a class component must start with an uppercase letter.

Component Constructor
The constructor is called when the component is created. It is used to initialize the component's state and bind event handlers. In React, we use state to manage data that can change over time and cause the component to re-render.

Example with Constructor
Here's an example of a class component with a constructor that initializes the state:



class Cat extends React.Component {
  constructor() {
    // Call the parent class's constructor
    super();
    // Initialize the component's state
    this.state = { color: "orange" };
  }

  render() {
    return <h1>Meow's color is {this.state.color}</h1>;
  }
}
Explanation


Constructor: The constructor method is called when an instance of the component is created.
super(): The super() call is necessary to call the constructor of the parent class (React.Component). This ensures that the component inherits all the functionality of React.Component.


State Initialization: The state object is initialized in the constructor. This example initializes the state with a single property color set to "orange".
Render Method: The render method returns the HTML to be rendered. It can access the component's state using this.state.
