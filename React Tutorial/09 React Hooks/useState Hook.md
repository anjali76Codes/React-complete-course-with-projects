React useState Hook
The useState hook is a feature in React that allows us to add state to function components. This guide will explain how to use the useState hook to manage state in our React components.

Importing useState
To use the useState hook, we first need to import it from the React library:



import { useState } from "react";
Initializing useState
We initialize state by calling the useState function and passing the initial state as an argument. The function returns an array with two elements: the current state value and a function to update that state.



import { useState } from "react";

const App = () => {
    const [name, setName] = useState('');
};
In this example, name is the state variable, and setName is the function used to update the state. The initial state is set to an empty string.

Reading a State
You can read the state variable just like any other variable.



import { useState } from "react";

const App = () => {
    const [name, setName] = useState('');

    return <h1>My name is {name}</h1>;
};
Updating a State
To update the state, use the function provided by useState (in this case, setName).



import { useState } from "react";

const App = () => {
    const [name, setName] = useState('');
    setName('Lovish');

    return <h1>My name is {name}</h1>;
};
Note: Typically, you would call setName in response to an event, such as a button click, rather than directly in the component body.

State Can Hold Any Datatype
State variables can hold any data type, such as strings, numbers, booleans, arrays, and objects.

Example with an Object

import { useState } from "react";

const App = () => {
    const [data, setData] = useState({
        name: 'Lovish',
        age: 21
    });

    return <h1>My name is {data.name} and my age is {data.age}</h1>;
};


Updating Objects and Arrays in State
When updating objects or arrays in state, use the spread operator to ensure that the state updates correctly without mutating the original state.

Example

import { useState } from "react";

const App = () => {
    const [data, setData] = useState({
        name: 'Lovish',
        age: 21
    });

    return (
        <>
            <h1>My name is {data.name} and my age is {data.age}</h1>
            <button onClick={() => setData({ ...data, name: 'CWH' })}>Click Me</button>
        </>
    );
};

export default App;
In this example, clicking the button updates the name property of the data object in the state, leaving the other properties unchanged. This is done by using the spread operator (...data) to copy the existing properties of the data object into a new object, and then overriding the name property with a new value.



Conclusion
The useState hook is a powerful and flexible way to manage state in React function components. By understanding how to initialize, read, and update state, as well as how to handle complex state structures like objects and arrays, you can create dynamic and interactive React applications.
