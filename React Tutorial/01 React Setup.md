My React App
This README file provides step-by-step instructions for setting up and starting a React application.

Prerequisites
Node.js: Ensure you have Node.js installed. You can download it from here.
Creating Your First React App
1. Create a React Application
Open your terminal in the directory where you would like to create your application. Use one of the following commands:

To create a React application named my-react-app:

sh
Copy code
npx create-react-app my-react-app
To create a React application in the current directory without specifying a name:

sh
Copy code
npx create-react-app .
Note: When choosing a folder name, make sure there are no spaces or capital letters due to npm naming restrictions.

2. Navigate to Your Project Directory
If you specified a folder name, navigate into that folder using the following command:

sh
Copy code
cd my-react-app
3. Start the Application
Start your React application with the following command:

sh
Copy code
npm start
This will start the development server and open your new React app in your default web browser. If it does not open automatically, you can access it by navigating to http://localhost:3000 in your browser.
